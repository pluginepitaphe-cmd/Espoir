The AI engineer successfully migrated and enhanced the SIPORTS application, transforming it from a Flask/React/SQLite stack to run within the target Kubernetes environment (React frontend, FastAPI-adapted backend, retaining SQLite). Initial efforts focused on making the existing application functional, including fixing routing, environment variable handling ( to ), and broken buttons. Subsequently, the engineer implemented significant feature enhancements: a professional analytics dashboard, a real-time notification system, an AI recommendation engine, and an advanced calendar. Most recently, the engineer integrated a comprehensive visitor package system based on the official website. The current task involves implementing partner and exhibitor packages with an advanced matching system, and optimizing pricing. The process was iterative, with the AI consistently addressing user feedback and integrating new functionalities.

The primary objective was to make the SIPORTS maritime event application fully functional, standalone, and capable of automatic data synchronization with WordPress. This involved adapting an existing Flask/React/SQLite application to a Kubernetes environment expecting FastAPI/React/MongoDB, specifically ensuring the backend runs on port 8001 with  prefixes, and the frontend connects via .

Upon initial functionality, the user requested application improvements and recommendations. This led to the implementation of:
1.  A professional analytics dashboard with real-time graphs.
2.  A real-time notification system.
3.  An intelligent AI recommendation engine.
4.  A comprehensive professional calendar.
5.  Detailed exhibitor profile pages.
6.  A functional messaging system.

Following these enhancements, the user requested the integration of a visitor package system (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP Pass) based on , including a dedicated page, backend support, and UI integration (badges, navigation links).

The most recent request is to adapt the application for partner and exhibitor packages and create an advanced matching system based on a provided sponsoring document, with a follow-up to optimize the minimum budget for these packages.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (adapted Flask logic), SQLite database.
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes environment, Supervisorctl for service management.
- **Inter-service Communication**: Environment variables (, ),  prefix for backend routes.
- **State Management**: React Context (AuthContext, PackageLimitContext).
- **Utilities**: PyMuPDF for PDF parsing, Recharts for data visualization.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture comprises a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing an SQLite database for data persistence. The entire application is deployed within a Kubernetes environment.



-   ****: This is the core of the backend. Initially a FastAPI template, its content was replaced and adapted from the original Flask  of SIPORTS. It now handles all API endpoints, database interactions (SQLite), and business logic for users, authentication, exhibitors, partners, and the newly added visitor/partner packages and matching system.
-   ****: The main React component and central router for the application. It defines all the frontend routes, including those for new pages like , , , , , and . It also integrates key context providers like  and .
-   ****: This file manages API calls from the frontend to the backend. It was updated to correctly use  and ensures all calls are prefixed with .
-   ****: Configures the Vite development server for the frontend. It was updated to correctly handle hot reloading, port mapping (3000), and to include  for the preview URL.
-   ****: Manages user authentication state globally. It was updated to include user profile details like  and future .
-   ****: A newly introduced context provider that checks user package limitations, enabling or disabling features based on the  and will manage  limits. It wraps the main application routes.
-   ****: A new page displaying the four visitor package tiers (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP) with their respective features and pricing, mirroring the official Siportevent website.
-   ****: Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend, including new ones like  for PDF processing.
-   ****: A newly created page intended to display partner/exhibitor package tiers based on the sponsoring document.
-   ****: A newly created page for the advanced matching functionality between different user types.

<pending_tasks>
-   **WordPress Synchronization**: Implement the REST API for WordPress and configure data synchronization webhooks.
-   **Optimize Minimum Budget for Packages**: Refine the pricing or budget structure for the partner and exhibitor packages.
-   **Integrate Partner/Exhibitor Package Logic**: Complete the frontend and backend integration for the partnership and exhibitor packages.
-   **Implement Advanced Matching Logic**: Fully develop and integrate the advanced matching system.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the Partner and Exhibitor Packages and Advanced Matching System based on the provided Sponsoring SIPORT.pdf document.

So far, the following actions have been taken:
1.  **PDF Analysis**: The  document was successfully downloaded and parsed to extract details about the sponsorship tiers. The AI identified four partnership levels: Platinum (8,000), Gold (8,000), Silver (8,000), and Port Museum (0,000).
2.  **Frontend Page Creation**:
    *   A new page, , has been created to display these partnership package details.
    *   Another new page, , has been created to house the advanced matching system functionality.
3.  **Backend Adaptation**: The backend server () has been modified to support the new  field in the database, implying schema updates or extensions to existing user/entity models. This involves adding endpoints to manage these new packages and potentially their associated quotas or features.
4.  **Next Steps in Progress**: The AI engineer was about to add the new routes for  and  into  and continue with the backend optimization for accessible budgets, as requested by the user.

The application currently has a fully functional visitor package system, and the foundation for partner/exhibitor packages and the advanced matching system is being laid out. The key nuance is adapting the existing Flask-based logic into the FastAPI structure while maintaining the SQLite database, and integrating new complex features like real-time analytics, AI recommendations, and now multi-tiered package management.
