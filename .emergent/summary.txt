The AI engineer successfully transformed the SIPORTS application from Flask/React/SQLite to FastAPI/React/SQLite within a Kubernetes environment. Initial efforts focused on core functionality and deployment issues. Subsequent phases added analytics, notifications, AI recommendations, and an advanced calendar. The recent work involved integrating a visitor package system, followed by partner/exhibitor packages and an advanced matching system. The engineer addressed critical bugs, including persistent admin authentication issues (fixed by correcting routing, , and  config) and ensuring backend API functionality. A reported mini-site display error was investigated but deemed non-critical. Following this, a major WordPress integration was initiated and largely completed, including generating a plugin, backend modifications, frontend adaptations, and deployment guides. The engineer then resolved Git conflicts for project archiving. Currently, the engineer is commencing work on SIPORTS v2.0, focusing on integrating an advanced AI chatbot using Anthropic Claude, and has requested the API key from the user.

The primary goal was to create a fully functional, standalone SIPORTS maritime event application, initially migrating from Flask/React/SQLite to FastAPI/React/SQLite on Kubernetes, ensuring proper URL/port configuration ( prefix, ). After basic functionality, the user requested: professional analytics, real-time notifications, an intelligent AI recommendation engine, a comprehensive calendar, detailed exhibitor profiles, and a functional messaging system. A visitor package system (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP Pass) was then integrated, mimicking , with frontend, backend, and UI support. The most recent explicit requests included implementing partner/exhibitor packages and an advanced matching system based on Sponsoring SIPORT.pdf, testing all dashboards (visitor, partner, exhibitor, admin), confirming administrator account functionality, and then integrating the entire application with WordPress. Finally, the user requested a SIPORTS v2.0 with advanced AI features, including a chatbot.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Context (AuthContext, PackageLimitContext).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLite, Python (, PyJWT, websockets for v2.0).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisorctl.
-   **Integration**: WordPress (PHP plugin, MySQL, REST API, Shortcodes), AI/LLM (Anthropic Claude).
-   **Utilities**: PyMuPDF, Recharts.
-   **Testing**: , , .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and a FastAPI backend with an SQLite database, deployed in a Kubernetes environment managed by Supervisorctl.



-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. Changes included adding  field, new API endpoints for partner packages, matching, and crucial missing admin dashboard endpoints. Also modified to import and use new WordPress-related modules.
-   ****: Main React component. Routes added for , , and  for proper admin redirection.
-   ****: Frontend API utility. Modified to use , enforce  prefix, and include JWT authentication tokens.
-   ****: Manages user authentication. Updated to include  and , correctly retrieve  (from backend), and return user data on login for role-based redirection.
-   ****: Login page. Modified to redirect admin users to  instead of  based on  from .
-   ****: Fixed a JavaScript syntax error.
-   ****: Vite configuration. Updated  to include the preview URL for correct frontend loading.
-   ****: Corrected duplicated  entry to single, correct entry.
-   ****: (New) Defines WordPress database and JWT configurations.
-   ****: (New) Contains new FastAPI endpoints for WordPress authentication and data synchronization.
-   ****: (New) Frontend entry point for embedding the React app within WordPress.
-   ****: (New directory) Contains all files necessary for WordPress integration, including the PHP plugin, build scripts, deployment guides, and bundled assets.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Integrate Partner/Exhibitor Package Logic**: Complete frontend/backend integration for partnership and exhibitor packages.
-   **Implement Advanced Matching Logic**: Fully develop and integrate the advanced matching system.
-   **WordPress Synchronization**: Implement remaining REST API for WordPress and configure data synchronization webhooks (partial implementation done).
-   **Optimized Minimum Budget for Packages**: Refine pricing or budget structure for partner/exhibitor packages (explicitly excluded by user).

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer successfully addressed two critical bugs:
1.  **Admin Authentication Failure**: This was a major issue where admin users were redirected to the exhibitor dashboard () instead of the admin dashboard (), leading to 403 errors on admin APIs. The fix involved modifying  to redirect based on  received from 's login response. Additionally,  was updated to return user data, and  was updated to allow the preview URL. The  file for  was also corrected. Comprehensive backend and frontend testing confirmed this issue is fully resolved.
2.  **Mini-site Display Error**: This user-reported issue was investigated by examining  and taking screenshots. The engineer concluded that the mini-site editor's interface was functional and the reported error might be minor or an enhancement request rather than a critical bug, as no obvious display issues were found.

After successfully resolving these critical bugs and achieving 100% backend functionality and 7/12 (58.3%) frontend functionality with all critical features operational, the user requested to integrate and deploy the application into WordPress. The engineer has completed a significant portion of this task by:
*   Creating a WordPress plugin () and necessary build assets (, ).
*   Adding new backend files (, ) and modifying  to support WordPress integration (e.g., WordPress authentication, user/package sync endpoints).
*   Creating a WordPress-specific frontend entry point ().
*   Generating comprehensive documentation and scripts for deployment, including , , , , .
*   Successfully ran scripts to create a full deployment package (tar.gz, zip).
*   Addressed Git conflicts that prevented archiving, cleaning the repository.

Most recently, the user shifted focus to SIPORTS v2.0, explicitly requesting fonctionnalit√©s plus pousser ia chat bot. The engineer has initiated this new task, beginning by installing necessary Python libraries (, , ,  etc.) and has started planning the architecture for SIPORTS v2.0, specifically asking the user to choose an AI model for the chatbot (Claude was chosen) and to provide the Anthropic API key.
