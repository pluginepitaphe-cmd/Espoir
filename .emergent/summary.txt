The previous AI engineer successfully migrated SIPORTS from Flask/React to FastAPI/React/SQLite. This trajectory primarily documents extensive efforts to deploy the application's backend on Railway and connect it to a persistent PostgreSQL database, while simultaneously addressing Vercel frontend deployment challenges. Initial attempts with SQLite on Railway failed due to its ephemeral filesystem, necessitating a complex migration to PostgreSQL. The engineer meticulously guided the user through fixing dependencies, configuring , adding health checks, and managing environment variables, often adapting to new Railway-generated database URLs. Troubleshooting involved identifying issues like incorrect start commands, missing dependencies, and persistent SSL errors during database connection, which were eventually resolved by adding  to the PostgreSQL connection string. The backend is now fully operational and tested, handling authentication, chatbot services, package systems, and admin dashboards via PostgreSQL. The work concludes with the engineer creating an optimized Vercel frontend package, integrating the newly deployed Railway backend, and providing final instructions to connect the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The SIPORTS application is a comprehensive maritime event platform, initially migrated from Flask to FastAPI. Key functionalities include professional analytics, real-time notifications, an AI recommendation engine, an appointment calendar, exhibitor profiles, and a messaging system. It was expanded to support multi-tier visitor packages (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP Pass) and partner/exhibitor packages, with an advanced matching system. All associated dashboards (visitor, partner, exhibitor, admin) and administrator authentication are required. A significant integration with WordPress for embedding and data synchronization was pursued. A major feature is SIPORTS v2.0, introducing an advanced AI chatbot. Throughout development, critical bugs, including admin authentication and a Se connecter button fix, were addressed. The current phase focuses on achieving robust production deployment, specifically ensuring the backend is on Railway with a persistent database (migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL) and the frontend is on Vercel, with full connectivity and accessibility from  and mobile application stores.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a React/Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend. The backend initially used SQLite but was successfully migrated to PostgreSQL for persistent storage on Railway.


-   ****: The core FastAPI backend logic. Initially, it included database initialization with SQLite. Throughout the trajectory, it was heavily modified for PostgreSQL compatibility, including removing old  functions and integrating a new  module. Its  was adapted for robust production logging and  environment variable usage. In the final, monolithic version (), all logic (DB, chatbot, routes) was consolidated into this single file.
-   ****: (New) Introduced to abstract database connection logic, allowing for auto-detection and connection to either SQLite (for local development) or PostgreSQL (for production on Railway). It manages table creation and basic DB operations.
-   ****: Critical for managing Python dependencies. It was frequently updated to include necessary libraries like  (for PostgreSQL), ,  (for production server), , and . This file directly impacts the build success on Railway.
-   ****: (New) Replaced  for Railway-specific deployment configuration. It defines the  (NIXPACKS),  (using  for production with Uvicorn workers), , and . This file is crucial for Railway to correctly build and run the application.
-   ****: (New) A fallback or alternative process file for defining the application's startup command (). It provides redundancy for Railway deployment.
-   ****: A generated directory containing the final, complete backend package for production deployment. This package consolidated all necessary files, including the monolithic , optimized , , , and , tailored for Railway PostgreSQL deployment.
-   ****: A newly generated directory for the Vercel frontend. It includes  (for Vercel build configuration and routing),  files (for environment variables like ),  (for Next.js specific configurations), and placeholder  and  to demonstrate frontend API integration. This package is intended to simplify Vercel deployment by providing a pre-configured structure.
-   **Deployment Scripts & Guides**: Numerous  and  files (e.g., , , , , ) were created to document, automate, and troubleshoot the deployment process on both Railway and Vercel. They detail manual steps, provide automated scripts, and include diagnostic instructions.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate Partner/Exhibitor Package Logic (backend ready, frontend integration pending).
-   Implement Advanced Matching Logic (frontend/backend integration pending).
-   WordPress Synchronization (backend ready, full configuration/webhooks pending).
-   Complete the implementation of the professional mini-site for exhibitor profiles (frontend development).
-   Ensure both Vercel and Railway deployments are fully operational and accessible, including final connection of the frontend to the backend.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in the final steps of connecting the deployed backend on Railway with the user's existing frontend on Vercel. The backend has been confirmed to be 100% operational, including a successful migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL, resolved database connection SSL issues (using ), and full functionality for authentication, chatbot, packages, mini-sites, and admin dashboard.

The user had an existing Vercel frontend at  and . The AI engineer's current task is to ensure this frontend correctly connects to the newly deployed Railway backend at . This involves guiding the user to:
1.  **Add/Update Environment Variables in Vercel:** Specifically, setting  (and potentially , ) to the backend's Railway URL. The user confirmed No Environment Variables Added, so the AI engineer explicitly guided them on how to add it with name, value, and environments.
2.  **Redeploy the Vercel project:** After variable configuration.
3.  **Verify the connection:** By opening the Vercel frontend URL in a browser and checking for dynamic data, console errors, and network requests.

The very last exchange shows the AI engineer attempting to generate a new, comprehensive Vercel frontend package () which includes ,  files, , , and , to simplify the Vercel deployment and ensure all necessary configuration is present for a seamless connection to the Railway backend.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to finalize the Vercel frontend deployment by ensuring the newly generated package is used and correctly configured to connect to the Railway backend.
