The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the SIPORTS application from Flask/React/SQLite to FastAPI/React/SQLite within Kubernetes. Key features like analytics, notifications, AI recommendations, and an advanced calendar were integrated. Subsequent efforts focused on visitor, partner, and exhibitor packages, an advanced matching system, and crucial bug fixes, notably an admin authentication issue and a minor mini-site display error. A major WordPress integration was largely completed, involving custom backend modules, a WordPress plugin, and frontend adaptations. The most recent significant work involved developing SIPORTS v2.0 with an AI chatbot, initially using a mock service for testing, which was confirmed functional. A critical logical flaw in the Se connecter button on the Networking page was identified and corrected to redirect to login rather than initiate networking. Finally, the engineer began preparing the application for production deployment on Vercel and Railway, creating optimized versions and automated deployment scripts, and detailed guides. The current trajectory abruptly ends with a critical deployment error related to missing frontend environment files, interrupting the in-progress exhibitor profile enhancement.

<product_requirements>
The core requirement for SIPORTS was to develop a full-featured maritime event application, starting with a migration from Flask to FastAPI. Initial functionalities included professional analytics, real-time notifications, an intelligent AI recommendation engine, a comprehensive appointment calendar, detailed exhibitor profiles, and a messaging system. Subsequently, the user requested the implementation of a visitor package system (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP Pass) mimicking , followed by partner/exhibitor packages and an advanced matching system based on a provided PDF. All dashboards (visitor, partner, exhibitor, admin) and administrator authentication functionality were required to be tested and confirmed. A major integration with WordPress was then requested, requiring the application to be embedded and synchronized. The latest phase involves SIPORTS v2.0, focusing on advanced AI features, specifically an AI chatbot. The product has progressed through these stages, with features built and bugs addressed, including a critical admin authentication fix and a corrected Se connecter logic. The application is now being prepared for production deployment.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Context (AuthContext, PackageLimitContext).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLite, Python (PyJWT),  (for AI chatbot simulation), .
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisorctl, Vercel, Railway.
-   **Integration**: WordPress (PHP plugin, MySQL, REST API, Shortcodes), AI/LLM (Anthropic Claude, Ollama).
-   **Utilities**: PyMuPDF, Recharts.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, primarily backed by an SQLite database, within a Kubernetes environment. Deployment for production targets Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend).



-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. Modified to integrate , , and recently,  with new AI chatbot endpoints.
-   ****: (New) Contains the mock AI chatbot logic. Important for isolating chatbot functionality and enabling testing before full Ollama integration.
-   ****: (New) Frontend React component for the AI chatbot UI.
-   ****: Main React component. Routes added for various new features and pages, including , , and dynamically for exhibitor mini-sites. It also imports and renders the  component.
-   ****: Significant refactor. Initially, its Se connecter button was incorrectly trying to establish a connection with another participant. This was corrected to redirect to  for user authentication, aligning with package-based access to messaging/appointment features. Removed  and  logic.
-   ****: Vite configuration. Updated multiple times to add  entries (e.g., , ) to resolve host blocking issues during frontend access.
-   ****: Corrected duplicated  entry and ensured it's singular and correct. Also, a new  file was created (or attempted to be created) to satisfy deployment environment expectations.
-   ** & **: (New) Minimized versions of the backend API and dependencies for a clean production deployment without WordPress.
-   ** & **: (New) Optimized production versions of the backend with WordPress integration, including new  and .
-   ** & **: (New) Created as part of the ongoing task to enhance exhibitor profiles with mini-site styling.
-   **Deployment Scripts & Guides**: Numerous  scripts (e.g., , , ) and  guides (, , ) were created to automate and document the Vercel/Railway deployment process, including tailored guides for mobile and specific user credentials.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Integrate Partner/Exhibitor Package Logic**: Complete frontend/backend integration for partnership and exhibitor packages. (This was a prior pending task, partially completed with package definition but matching/full integration still needed.)
-   **Implement Advanced Matching Logic**: Fully develop and integrate the advanced matching system.
-   **WordPress Synchronization**: Implement remaining REST API for WordPress and configure data synchronization webhooks. (Partial implementation done, but full sync still pending).
-   **Exhibitor Profile Enhancement**: Complete the implementation of the professional mini-site for exhibitor profiles (currently interrupted by a deployment error).
-   **Production Deployment Fix**: Resolve the  file missing error during emergent deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the exhibitor profile to display a mini-site, styled like . This involved examining  and creating new components:  and . The intention was to integrate these into the application's routing (implied by the addition of routes like  in ).

However, this feature development was abruptly interrupted by a critical error during a deployment attempt reported by the user: failed to read env file frontend/.env: open /tmp/agent-env-.../app/frontend/.env: no such file or directory. This indicates that the deployment environment is expecting a  file within a  directory, which is not the current project's structure (where frontend source is in  and the  is at the root ).

The AI engineer has already attempted to address this deployment issue once (), but the error message recurred immediately in the subsequent message (). The current state of work is therefore focused on diagnosing and fixing this persistent  file not found error during the deployment process, before resuming work on the exhibitor mini-site enhancement. The engineer's last action was stating the intention to create this structure ().

The next step is to resolve the  missing error to enable successful deployment.
