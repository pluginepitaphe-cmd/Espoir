The previous AI engineer successfully migrated SIPORTS from Flask/React to FastAPI/React/SQLite in Kubernetes, integrating core features, package systems, an AI chatbot, and WordPress. Work then shifted to production deployment on Vercel and Railway. Key challenges involved persistent Vercel build errors related to the  functions property and  resolution due to repository structure assumptions. For Railway, direct automated deployment via CLI tokens faced issues, leading to the creation of extensive manual setup guides and diagnostic scripts. Backend code was validated and fixed for missing dependencies and port configuration. The trajectory ends with the user confirming a Railway deployment but needing guidance on locating its URL. The engineer has focused on robust deployment solutions, providing multiple guides and scripts.

The primary goal for SIPORTS was to build a comprehensive maritime event application, initially migrating from Flask to FastAPI. Core functionalities included professional analytics, real-time notifications, an AI recommendation engine, a detailed appointment calendar, exhibitor profiles, and a messaging system. Subsequent phases involved implementing a multi-tier visitor package system (Free, Basic, Premium, VIP Pass), followed by partner/exhibitor packages and an advanced matching system based on a provided PDF. All associated dashboards (visitor, partner, exhibitor, admin) and administrator authentication were required and confirmed. A significant integration with WordPress was pursued, necessitating embedding the application and synchronizing data. The latest major feature is SIPORTS v2.0, introducing an advanced AI chatbot. Throughout development, bugs were addressed, including an admin authentication fix and correction of the Se connecter button logic on the Networking page. The application is now being prepared for production deployment.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Context.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLite, Python (PyJWT, , ),  (for AI chatbot simulation).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisorctl, Vercel, Railway, Docker.
-   **Integration**: WordPress (PHP, MySQL, REST API), AI/LLM.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend () and a FastAPI backend (), leveraging an SQLite database (). It's designed for Kubernetes, with production deployment targeting Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend).


-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. Modified to integrate chatbot and . Crucially, its  was updated to initialize  upon startup if not exists and the  environment variable was adjusted to default to  for Railway compatibility.
-   ****: (New) Houses the mock AI chatbot logic, separating AI concerns.
-   ****: (New) React component for the AI chatbot UI.
-   ****: Main React router. Routes were added for , , and dynamic exhibitor mini-sites ().
-   ****: Refactored to redirect the Se connecter button to  for authentication, removing direct connection request logic.
-   ****: Updated to include  for development and preview URLs.
-   ** & **:  at root holds . A new  was created (or attempted) to resolve deployment expectation issues, though the initial error was related to its presence in  not the correct root path.
-   ** & **: Optimized backend and dependencies for non-WordPress production.
-   ** & **: Optimized backend and dependencies for WordPress integrated production, using  and .
-   ** & **: (New) Frontend components for enhancing exhibitor profiles with mini-site styling.
-   **Deployment Scripts & Guides (Numerous .sh and .md files)**: A significant number of scripts and markdown guides were created (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc.). These files aim to automate, document, and troubleshoot the Vercel/Railway deployment process, providing step-by-step instructions, one-click solutions, and debugging aids for various deployment issues (e.g., Vercel  property,  resolution, Railway CLI authentication).
-   ****: (New) Dockerfile for containerizing the backend for Railway deployment.
-   ****: (New) Corrected backend dependencies, including  and  for JWT handling.
-   ****: Modified to remove empty  property and adjusted to account for correct frontend build paths, addressing Vercel deployment errors.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in continuous efforts to achieve successful production deployment of the SIPORTS application on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend). This involved extensive troubleshooting of deployment-related errors.

Specifically, the AI engineer addressed:
1.  **Backend Deployment on Railway**: After initial attempts with  failed due to non-interactive mode, the engineer created numerous scripts and guides for manual and automated Railway setup, including , , , and comprehensive setup guides like , . The engineer identified and fixed missing Python dependencies (, , ) and adjusted the default backend port to  in  for Railway compatibility.
2.  **Frontend Deployment on Vercel**: Addressed two recurring Vercel build errors:
    *   functions should not have fewer than 1 property: This was fixed by removing the empty  block in .
    *   Could not resolve entry module index.html: This error persisted across different GitHub repositories (, ) and was identified as a mismatch between Vercel's expectation of  at the repository root and the actual project structure or Vercel configuration. The AI engineer provided solutions involving creating correct  configurations (, , ) and creating guides/scripts to correct the GitHub repository structure for Vercel deployment (, , ).

The very last user message explicitly states, Jai fais deployment sur railway mais je vois rien ou je dois partir ?? (I deployed on Railway but I don't see anything, where should I go?). This indicates that the user successfully initiated a Railway deployment but needs guidance on how to access or locate the deployed application's URL. The AI engineer's immediate response acknowledges this and states the intent to help the user find the URL.
